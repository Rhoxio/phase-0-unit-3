 // U3.W7: Code Combat Challenge

// I worked on this challenge by myself



// Release 1: Consider the syntax
// What are you doing in each of these missions?

// You are essentially using methods to move and attack like in a traditional RPG.
// Each item you acquire gives you a few more methods to use. 


// Release 2: Analyze the syntax
// Can you break down each command to determine what it's doing? Select two to break down.
// The boots have methods to move in each cardinal direction. this.MoveRight(); for example
// moves you right one "section".
// For the sword, you had this.Attack(); and you could set it to attack something with a certain name.
// That is at least until you get the glasses, which give you the ability to "look" for an enemy that is nearby.



// Release 3: Answer the following questions:
//   - What is `this` referring to? Think programming-wise rather than in the terms of the game.
//   - What does the `()` do in JavaScript?
//   - What is the point of the semicolons?
//   
//	"This" is refering to the item itself. You could say that it refers to the object within the programming
// 	specifically called 'this'. 
//	
//	The () in javascript denotes a parameter that can be set if the method/function allows it, much like it does in Ruby.
//
//	Semicolons in javascript are essentially separators. It tells the interpreter that one section of code is
//  seperate from another part of the code. 


// Release 4: Reflect
// Do you think the game succeeds at its mission to teach JavaScript?
// What does it do well? What does it not do well?
// Were you able to use your Ruby knowledge to break down two
// of the commands effectively?

// Write your reflection here.

// I think the game has a huge amount of potential. I noticed a few bugs with the enemy AI, but that is hardly
// an issue since the game is still in active development. The game does a wonderful job of introducing to you how objects
// work, but I think a more formal explanation of objects themselves before you are thrown in to the world would be beneficial
// to someone who is new to coding. This could be implemented in a few ways. Integrating it directly in to a combat system with
// multiple moves, like I think is done later in the game, would really bring it to life.

// I was easily able to understand what was happening in the game with the knowledge I had from working with Ruby. I didn't 
// like how it simply threw you in and had you using commands without a basis, though.
