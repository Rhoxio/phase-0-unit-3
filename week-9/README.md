# SQL and Review


<!-- You've learned a lot of diverse material in Phase 0, and now you are two weeks away from Phase 1. We hope you're excited! These weeks will have a lot of review and more options for how to spend your time. Take the time you need to review important concepts.

We typically release the last two weeks together so students can be more flexible with their coding schedules which should help with moving, etc.

## Submitting your work
You need to submit your work on [apply.devbootcamp.com](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) by Sunday at 11:59pm. When you log in, look at your profile page. There will be "Unit 3 Week 8 Submission" and "Unit 3 Week 9 Submission" forms. **You need to submit your work at the end of each week.**

## Sync DBC's Changes
####It's time to sync changes from DevBootcamp's phase_0_unit_3 master repo.
You'll need to fetch changes into your `phase_0_unit_3` repository from DevBootcamp's master repo to get the new curriculum. You'll be syncing your local repo with the repo on github.com.

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/fetching-changes.md)!
Modify them for unit 3.

You will want to run and modify all files from your local repository on your computer. Use the terminal to navigate to the various challenge directories and submit your solutions as directed.

When you make updates to the files (or add a file), you should commit your work the same way you did for your website through the app. Include a commit message that describes what you've changed.




## Link Issues in the Repository
You now know enough to fix broken links in your repo! If you run into a 404 error navigating through the directory online, go to the file where the error is, see what the link is. Is it to an internal or external file? If internal, do you see a file named something similarly in the repo? If so, you'll want to figure out why the link is broken and fix it. If it's to an external resource,  Definitely let us know if a link is broken so we can fix it, but take some time to research it as well.
